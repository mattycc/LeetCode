26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array    --Easy

    Given a sorted array *nums*, remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each element appear only *once* and return the new length.

    Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** with O(1) extra memory.

    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Given nums = [1,1,2],
    
    Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
    
    It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
    ```

    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],
    
    Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
    
    It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
    ```

    **Clarification:**

    Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

    Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

    Internally you can think of this:

    ```
    // nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
    int len = removeDuplicates(nums);
    
    // any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
    // using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        print(nums[i]);
    }
    ```

    **Solutions:**

    26.1 Two pointers method. At the beginning, two pointers point to the start of array. If the numbers they point to are equal, move formard the fast pointer; if the numbers are not equal, move forward both pointers.

    ```java
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
            int pre = 0, cur = 0, n = nums.length;
                  while (cur < n) {
                      if (nums[pre] == nums[cur]) ++cur;
                      else nums[++pre] = nums[cur++];
                  }
                  return nums.length==0 ? 0 : (pre + 1);
              }
    ```

    At the beginning, the two pointers are not point to the start. Instead, one points to nums[0], one points to sums[1].

    ```java
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
            if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
            int slow = 0;
            for (int fast = 1; fast < nums.length; fast++) {
                if (nums[fast] != nums[slow]) {
                    slow++;
                    nums[slow] = nums[fast];
                }
            }
            return slow + 1;
        }
    ```

27. Remove Element    --Easy

    Given an array *nums* and a value *val*, remove all instances of that value [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)and return the new length.

    Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** with O(1) extra memory.

    The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Given nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3,
    
    Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
    
    It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
    ```

    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Given nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2,
    
    Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 1, 3, 0, and 4.
    
    Note that the order of those five elements can be arbitrary.
    
    It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
    ```

    **Clarification:**

    Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

    Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

    Internally you can think of this:

    ```
    // nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
    int len = removeElement(nums, val);
    
    // any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
    // using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        print(nums[i]);
    }
    ```

    **Solutions:**

    27.1 Use two pointers to point to the start of array. If the current number doesn't equal to the target, assign the number of slow pointer to the fast pointer position. Move the slow and fast pointer forward. If the current number equals to the target, move the fast pointer forward.

    ```java
    public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
            int cur, pre = 0;
            for (cur=0; cur<nums.length; cur++){
                if(nums[cur]!=val){
                    nums[pre++] = nums[cur];
                }
            }
            return pre;
        }
    ```

    27.2 Each time find a target value, replace it with the the 'last' number.

    ```java
    public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
            int len = nums.length, i = 0;
            while (i<len){
                if(nums[i]==val)
                    nums[i]=nums[--len];
                else
                    i++;
            return len;
        }
    ```

28. Implement strStr()    --Easy

    Implement [strStr()](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strstr/).

    Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or **-1** if needle is not part of haystack.

    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
    Output: 2
    ```

    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
    Output: -1
    ```

    **Clarification:**

    What should we return when `needle` is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

    For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when `needle` is an empty string. This is consistent to C's [strstr()](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strstr/) and Java's [indexOf()](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#indexOf(java.lang.String)).

    **Constraints:**

    `haystack` and `needle` consist only of lowercase English characters.

    **Solutions:**

    28.1 brute-force method: 

    ```java
    public int strStr(String haystack, String needle) {
            if(needle==null||needle.length()==0)
                return 0;
            if(haystack==null||haystack.length()==0||haystack.length()<needle.length())
                return -1;
            if(haystack.equals(needle))
                return 0;
            int i=0, j=0;
            for(i=0; i<haystack.length(); i++) {
                if (haystack.charAt(i) == needle.charAt(j) && (i + needle.length() <= haystack.length())) {
                    for (j = 0; j < needle.length(); j++) {
                        if (i < haystack.length() && haystack.charAt(i) == needle.charAt(j)) {
                            i++;
                        } else {
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                    if (j == needle.length())  //if find, return the start position
                        return i - j;
                    i = i - j;                //if not find, assign i to the next position, reset j
                    j = 0;
                }
            }
            return -1;
        }
    ```

    28.2 two pointers method:

    ```java
    public int strStr(String haystack, String needle) {
            if(needle==null||needle.length()==0)
                return 0;
            if(haystack==null||haystack.length()==0||haystack.length()<needle.length())
                return -1;
            if(haystack.equals(needle))
                return 0;
            int cur1 = 0, cur2 = 0;
      			//if the length of the left haystack is less than the length of needle, it fails
            while(cur1 < haystack.length()-needle.length()+1){   
             		//find the position of the first needle character in the haystack string
                while (cur1<haystack.length() && haystack.charAt(cur1)!=needle.charAt(cur2)) 
                    cur1++;
                while(cur1<haystack.length() && cur2<needle.length() && haystack.charAt(cur1) == needle.charAt(cur2)){
                    cur1 ++;
                    cur2 ++;
                }
                if(cur2 == needle.length())
                    return cur1 - cur2;
                cur1 = cur1 - cur2 + 1;
                cur2 = 0;
            }
            return -1;
        }
    ```
