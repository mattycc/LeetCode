937. Reorder Data in Log Files --Easy

     You have an array of `logs`. Each log is a space delimited string of words.

     For each log, the first word in each log is an alphanumeric *identifier*. Then, either:

     - Each word after the identifier will consist only of lowercase letters, or;
     - Each word after the identifier will consist only of digits.

     We will call these two varieties of logs *letter-logs* and *digit-logs*. It is guaranteed that each log has at least one word after its identifier.

     Reorder the logs so that all of the letter-logs come before any digit-log. The letter-logs are ordered lexicographically ignoring identifier, with the identifier used in case of ties. The digit-logs should be put in their original order.

     Return the final order of the logs.

     **Example 1:**

     ```
     Input: logs = ["dig1 8 1 5 1","let1 art can","dig2 3 6","let2 own kit dig","let3 art zero"]
     Output: ["let1 art can","let3 art zero","let2 own kit dig","dig1 8 1 5 1","dig2 3 6"]
     ```

     **Constraints:**

     1. `0 <= logs.length <= 100`
     2. `3 <= logs[i].length <= 100`
     3. `logs[i]` is guaranteed to have an identifier, and a word after the identifier.

     **Solution:**

     write a comparator, then use this comparator the reorder logs

     in comparator:

     `< return -1` 

     `= return 0` 

     `> return 1`

     ```java
     public static String[] reorderLogFiles(String[] logs) {
     
             Comparator<String> myComp = new Comparator<String>() {
                 @Override
                 public int compare(String s1, String s2) {
                     int s1Space = s1.indexOf(" ");
                     int s2Space = s2.indexOf(" ");
                     String iden1 = s1.substring(0, s1Space);
                     String iden2 = s2.substring(0, s2Space);
                     String log1 = s1.substring(s1Space + 1);
                     String log2 = s2.substring(s2Space + 1);
     
                     if (log1.charAt(0) <= '9') {
                         if (log2.charAt(0) <= '9')
                             return 0;               //return 0 means equal
                         if (log2.charAt(0) > '9')
                             return 1;               //return 1 means >
                     }
     
                     if (log2.charAt(0) <= '9') {
                         return -1;                  //return -1 means <
                     }
     
                     if (log1.equals(log2)) {
                         return iden1.compareTo(iden2);
                     } else {
                         return log1.compareTo(log2);
                     }
     
                 }
             };
     
             Arrays.sort(logs,myComp);
             return logs;
     
         }
     ```
