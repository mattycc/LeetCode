300. Longest Increasing Subsequence  --Medium

     Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

     **Example:**

     ```
     Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
     Output: 4 
     Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4. 
     ```

     **Note:** 

     - There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
     - Your algorithm should run in O(*n^2^*) complexity.

     **Follow up:** Could you improve it to O(*n* log *n*) time complexity?

     **Solutions:** 300.1 dp for each element, iterate elements before it in linear time to calculate the value. O(N^2^)

     ```java
     public int lengthOfLIS(int[] nums) {
             int n = nums.length;
             int max = nums.length == 0 ? 0 : 1;
             int[] dp = new int[n];
             Arrays.fill(dp, 1);
             for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
                 for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                     if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
                         dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
                         max = Math.max(max, dp[i]);
                     }
     
                 }
             }
             return max;
         }
     ```

     300.2 use an array tails[k], represents the tail element of k+1 subsequence. the priciple is try to make the tails element kept as minimum as possible. O(NlogN)

     ```java
     public int lengthOfLIS2(int[] nums) {
             int[] tails = new int[nums.length];
             int res = 0;
             for (int num : nums) {
                 int i = 0, j = res;
                 while (i < j) {    //use binary search to find the position to update num
                     int m = (i + j) / 2;
                     if (tails[m] < num) i = m + 1;
                     else j = m;
                 }
                 tails[i] = num;
                 if (res == i) res++;
             }
             return res;
         }
     ```
