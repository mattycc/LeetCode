763. Partition Labels  --Medium

     A string `S` of lowercase English letters is given. We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

     **Example 1:**

     ```
     Input: S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
     Output: [9,7,8]
     Explanation:
     The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
     This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
     A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts. 
     ```

     **Note:**

     - `S` will have length in range `[1, 500]`.
     - `S` will consist of lowercase English letters (`'a'` to `'z'`) only.

     **Solution:**

     1. traverse S and record the last index of each char.
     2. traverse S again. use two pointers to cut the string. update the right pointer every loop, when the loop i equals to right, which means the last index of chars before right are all smaller than the current i char's last index, thus we can divide those as a part.

     ```java
     public List<Integer> partitionLabels(String S) {
             int n = S.length();
             List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
             int[] dict = new int[26];
             for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                 dict[S.charAt(i)-'a'] = i;
             }
     
     
             int left = 0, right= 0;
             for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                 right = Math.max(right, dict[S.charAt(i)-'a']);
                 if (right == i){
                     res.add(right-left+1);
                     left = right+1;
                 }
     
             }
             return res;
         }
     ```
