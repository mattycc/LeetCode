235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree  --Easy

     Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

     According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

     Given binary search tree: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]

     **Example 1:**

     ```
     Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
     Output: 6
     Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
     ```

     **Example 2:**

     ```
     Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
     Output: 2
     Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
     ```

     **Constraints:**

     - All of the nodes' values will be unique.
     - p and q are different and both values will exist in the BST.

     **Solution:**

     ```java
     public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
             while(true){
                 if(root.val>p.val && root.val>q.val)
                     root = root.left;
                 else if(root.val<p.val && root.val<q.val)
                     root = root.right;
                 else
                     return root;
             }
         }
     ```

236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree  --Medium

     Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

     According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

     Given the following binary tree: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]

     <img src="img/235-240-2.png"/>

     **Example 1:**

     ```
     Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
     Output: 3
     Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
     ```

     **Example 2:**

     ```
     Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
     Output: 5
     Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
     ```

     **Note:**

     - All of the nodes' values will be unique.
     - p and q are different and both values will exist in the binary tree.

     **Solution:**

     236.1 for each node, if it is the lowest common ancestor of p and q, it must be one of the two following situations:

     1.  the left subtree and the right subtree of this node contain p and q respectively
     2.  the left subtree or the right subtree if this node contains p or q and the node it self is q or p.

     Thus, we can recursively traverse tree from bottom to up. Return true when: 1. this node is q or p; 2. left or right subtree (or both) contains q or p.

     ```java
     class Solution {
         public static TreeNode res1;
         public Solution(){
             this.res1 = null;
         }
         public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
             boolean a = contain(root,p,q);
             return res1;
         }
     
         public static boolean contain(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q){
             if(root==null)
                 return false;
             boolean left = contain(root.left,p,q);
             boolean right = contain(root.right,p,q);
             if((left && right) || ((left||right) && (root.val == p.val || root.val==q.val))) 
                 res1 = root;
             return (left || right || root.val == p.val || root.val == q.val);
         }
     }
     ```

     236.2 directly return tree node. If node is null or the subtree which node is root does not contain p or q, return null. Otherwise, if node is p or q, return node. If the return value of left subtree is null, it means there is no q or p in left subtree, then return right. If the return valur of right subtree is null, it means there is no q or p in right subtree, thus return right. If neither the return value of left subtree nor right subtree is null, it means left subtree and right subtree each contain q and p respectively, then return root(node).

     ```java
     public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
             if(root == null || root == p || root == q) return root;
             TreeNode left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
             TreeNode right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
             if(left == null) return right;
             if(right == null) return left;
             return root;
         }
     ```
