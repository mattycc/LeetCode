     You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.

     **Example 1:**

     ```
     Input: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]
     Output: 4
     Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
     5=5
     5=2+2+1
     5=2+1+1+1
     5=1+1+1+1+1
     ```

     **Example 2:**

     ```
     Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
     Output: 0
     Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.
     ```

     **Example 3:**

     ```
     Input: amount = 10, coins = [10] 
     Output: 1
     ```

     **Solutions:** This question is similar with problem 322. But we cannot use the method we use in 322 to solve this. For this question, we want to know the number of combinations. However, use the dp loops in 322 will lead to a permutation result:

     ```java
     for (int j = 1; j <= amount; j++){ //enumerate amount
                 for (int coin : coins){ //enumerate coins
                     if (j < coin) continue;
                     dp[j] += dp[j-coin];
                 }
             }
     ```

     We can use two methods to solve this problem.

     518.1 redefine subproblem. In above codes, subproblem dp[i] represents the number of ways we can get amount i. In this situation, this will be a repetition (2,1 and 1,2). Thus we can change the definition of dp[i] to the number of ways we can get amount i when we must use coin c. In this situation, for each certain unique combination, we only count once for each amount.

     ```java
     public int change(int amount, int[] coins) {
         int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
         dp[0] = 1;
     
         for (int coin : coins) {
           for (int x = coin; x < amount + 1; ++x) {
             dp[x] += dp[x - coin];
           }
         }
         return dp[amount];
       }
     ```

     518.2 we also can solve this problem by define a 2-d dp(k)(i) array to represent the number of ways to get amount i when we use previous k coins. In this case, the order of two loops is not important, we can change them. However, int the 518.1 one dimension dp array, we cannot change the order of loop at will.

     ```java
     public int change(int amount, int[] coins) {
             int K = coins.length + 1;
             int I = amount + 1;
             int[][] DP = new int[K][I];
             //initialize
             for (int k = 0; k < K; k++){
                 for (int i = 0; i < I; i++){
                     DP[k][i] = 0;
                 }
             }
             for (int k = 0; k < coins.length + 1; k++){
                 DP[k][0] = 1;
             }
             for (int k = 1; k <= coins.length ; k++){
                 for (int i = 1; i <= amount; i++){
                     // two situation:
                   	// 1. use the k-th coin to get amount i
                   	// 2. not use the k-th coin to get amount i: dp[k-1][i]
                     if ( i >= coins[k-1]) {
                       	// coins[k-1]: coins starts from 0
                         DP[k][i] = DP[k][i-coins[k-1]] + DP[k-1][i]; 
                     } else{
                         DP[k][i] = DP[k-1][i];
                     }
                 }
             }
             return DP[coins.length][amount];
         }
     ```
